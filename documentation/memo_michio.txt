A file called "ctes3D" and makefile were missing in the original file you sent me before, so added.

**********************************
**** HOW TO COMPILE ON BRUTUS ****
**********************************
Once you're logged in to Brutus, type

> module load intel
> module load open_mpi

to load Intel compiler and openMPI. To make sure these are successfully, type

> module list

which shows all modules that are loaded. You should get the following five items

1) modules
2) icc/10.1.018(default:10)
3) ifc/10.1.018(default:10)
4) intel/10.1.018(default:10)
5) open_mpi/1.4.5(default:1.4)

If you want them to be automatically loaded, you can edit a file .bash_profle in the home directly and add a line

module load intel open_mpi

at the end of the file. They will be loaded every time you are logged in.
Now you can type

> make ROUGHv7

in the directly you upload all the code and input files.



******************************
**** HOW TO RUN ON BRUTUS ****
******************************

To run the code, a command like

> bsub -oo ROUGHv7.txt -W 00:30 -n 16 mpirun ./ROUGHv7

will work. A little explanation,

-oo ROUGHv7.txt

The output text will be saved as ROUGHv7.txt once the run is completed. With the option -oo, it overwrites a file with the same name (if exists).

-W 00:30

A wall time 30 minutes.  

-n 16

It specifies the number of cores to be 16, which should be same number as shown in the file cted3D, parameter(numerop=16).
